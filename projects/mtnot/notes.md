* bare melodies need to being and end on tonic of scale
* prefer to end harmozied melodies below tonic of scale
* 2nd and 3rds should be used unsparingly
* high and low notes should not be more than a 10th apart
* legato or staccato indicators
* less than six measures are phrases, greater need titles (are "pieces")
* keep tempo consistent. (5/4 -> (2 + 3) | (3 + 2) which would sound bad)

### Challenge 0:

```
S = (e4, g4, a4, b4)
R = (1/5,1/5,1/5,2/5)
```

* Notes restricted to `S`
* Rhythm `R` (5/4)
* 3-6 bars
* At least one repeated measure
* Bonuse: first few measures don't use all four tones


### Challenge 1:

```
S = (f4,g4,b4,c4,f5,b5,c5,d5)
R_0 = (1/8,1/8,1/8,1/8,1/2,1/2)
R_1 = (1/4, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8, 1/4)
```

* Notes restricted to `S`
* Rhythm `R_0` and `R_1` (4/4)
* 3-6 bars
* Repeat measure at least twice


### Challenge 2:

```
S = (d4,a4,f4,e4,c4)
R = ((1/4,1/8,1/8,1/2) , (., 1/2, 1/2, 1/4)0
```

* Use only notes from S
* Notes must be played in order with repeats allowed (e.g. d4,d4,a4,f4,e4,c4,c4,c4,c4,d4,a4,a4 .. )
* Rhythm from R
* Six measures in length
