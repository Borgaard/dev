Business Notes to Myself
===

I'm still very much a novice at the non-technical side of business.
To help improve my views on business, I hope this list will help
encapsulate some knowledge that's out there.

There's a lot of folk lore wisdom as well as some research about strategies
for success.
Many of these are biased in one form or another (cultural, selective, etc.) but
often there's a grain of truth or wisdom in them.

These are a collection of thoughts on business from various sources around
the internet in addition to some of my own interpretation and experience.

The real teacher is by doing, so anything aside from trying with real stakes
will be academic.
The best these notes can be is a rough guide.

Personal Productivity
---

* Use TODO lists for daily tasks
  - Number of tasks should be 3-5

Also consider making a 'To Watch' and a 'For Later' list.
The 'To Watch' list is for  tasks that are not being blocked by
you but are being blocked by some other external agent.
The 'For Later' list are things you want to do but some other factor
has made it difficult for you to do right now (time, money, other priorities, etc.).

Do Something you Love
---

Or if not love, something you actively don't despise.

Whatever you do, you'll be doing it a lot, especially if you're making a livelyhood out of it.
If you actively hate the thing that you're spending most of your waking day on, especially
if it's now tied to your existence, that's a recipe for misery.

I don't think doing something that you're 'in love' with is necessary, I think there's a balance
between doing something you can stand, that isn't painful or something that gives you a clear benefit
for the sacrifice, but the sentiment stands.

Don't do something you hate, if you can help it, because that will lead to bitterness and misery.

Beware the Stampeding Hordes
---

Every area, even/especially technical ones, have fads.
Mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, programming, business, etc.
all have methodologies that will look naive with the benefit of hindsight.

Some current trends turn out to be fundamental and sometimes the kernel of quality
in a fad gets widespread adoption.
Knowing which is a short term fad or something more fundamental is hard without deep
expertise in the subject.

Always strive to understand what the value offering of a system is, on a deeper level.
This requires more work, especially when it comes to sifting through the hype cycle
that comes with every fad, but will give a clearer picture of which methodologies and
markets are worth pursuing.
This will also help in understanding which portions of a methodology or market are worth
pursuing without chasing the other red herrings that come with the fad and it's cheerleaders.

This has shades in many other 'rules of thumb', such as the Gartner hype cycle, Warren Buffet's strategy
of only investing in areas he understands, the 'no greater fool' idea and even 'do what you love'.

Focusing your attention where the stampeding hordes are going might lead to success but it will
be a gamble that the masses have determined the value.
If the masses are fickle and the focus shifts, often rapidly and drastically, you'll often be left
with experience that has no value and, more likely than not, be of the mentality to chase the new
fad that has appeared.
