Energy Consumption Stats
===

From the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3):

* Average yearly usage of 10.812 MWh (Megawatthours)
* ~30kWh daily usage

Highs of 15.435MWh (~42.28kWh/day) to lows of 6.166MWh (~17kWh/day).

As of now, for a consumer solar it's about <span>$</span>1 per Watt of solar.
Assuming a 12 hour window of sun at full power, and 36kWh usage, thats 3kW or
about <span>$</span>3k for the solar panels (at about .6x1x.035 m^3).

As of now, for consumer deep cycle lead acid batteries, it's about <span>$</span>.15 / (Watt hour).
At 36kWh, thats about <span>$</span>5400.

A LiFePO4 32650 5.5Ah 3.2V rechargeable battery goes for ~<span>$</span>120.00 / 80 units.
At 36kWh, that works out to about `(120 / (80*5.5*3.2)) * 36000 = <span>$</span>3070`

This does not include all the control hardware and electronics that are needed
for proper usage.

As a rough estimate, New York average price for <span>$</span>.1854 / kWh at 601 kWh / month
for about <span>$</span>111.32 / month or <span>$</span>1335.84 / year.

Interestingly, I think the blog post was trying to point out the absurdity of
continue economic growth but I take it as a rough time frame for our progression
on moving up the Kardashev scale.

There's some talk about wealth and CO2 emissions going hand in hand, with
some suggesting [a total civilization collapse](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/3/1/2012/esd-3-1-2012.html) (from ["Decline of the Empire" blog](http://www.declineoftheempire.com/2012/01/wealth-and-energy-consumption-are-inseparable.html)).

One post claims solar produces [20-30x less CO2 than coal](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/blogs/how-much-co2-does-one-solar-panel-create),
so I'm not sure if apocalyptic forecasts are to be believed.
