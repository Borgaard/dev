Bitcoin Price Bounds

```
~$280T        Global wealth
  21M         Total Bitcoins
```

Assuming Bitcoin stores 10% of the total value of domestic companies,
this gives 

```
     (0.1) * ($280 * 10^12) / (21 * 10^6 BTC)
 =  ~$1.3 * 10^6 / BTC
```

or about `$1.3M` per Bitcoin.

This gives a rough range of what the Bitcoin value should be.
Increasing the stored wealth increases the number as would
an increased global company market capitalization.
The 10% was chosen as an arbitrary number.
One can easily imagine 20%+ or more as also being reasonable.

As a guide, if Bitcoin should ever significantly exceed
the global wealth or still be volatile
after being valued at a significant percentage of the global wealth,
then this would indicate, to me, a bubble.

As has been said elsewhere, should Bitcoin store a significant amount
of wealth to warrant a $1M+/BTC, this would probably come with
some significant changes, such as:

* Major resellers accepting Bitcoin
* Banks going out of business or otherwise changing significantly
* Some countries or governments adopting Bitcoin as a major or primary currency

The point being that Bitcoin adoption doesn't happen in a vacuum.
If the price were to rise significantly, this would bring changes
to our everyday lives including the way we do banking.
