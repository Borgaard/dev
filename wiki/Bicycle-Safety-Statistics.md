Bicycle Safety Statistics
===

The basic question to answer is how safe is riding a bike
compared with driving a car.

37,461 motor deaths (2016)

1.15% to 2.6% fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles travelled (VMT).

Around 2.2M miles (2016) (light duty vehicle).

As a check, $ \frac{37,461 \text{deaths}}{2.2 \cdot 10^12 \text{VMT}} \approx 1.7% \text{ per 100M VMT}$ which is within range of the reported statistic above.

Pedalcyclist fatality count of 840 (2016).

Pedestrian fatality count of 5987 (2016).

If we take a rough estimate of the census 786k (pg2 census) bike commuters,
assume 2 mile commute to work each way for a total of 4 miles and 5 work days,
this leads to $ (786 \cdot 10^3) \cdot (\frac{5}{7}) \cdot (365) \cdot (4) \approx 8.2 \cdot 10^8 \text{ bike miles per year}$.

This gives the (large) estimate of 8.2% fatality rate per 100M bike miles travelled.

If we count by time instead, this is $ 800/(786000 * (46/60) * (5/7) * 365) \approx 5.1 \cdot 10^{-6} $
chance per hour of a fatality (bike).

85.4 percent of 150M workers drive to work ([src](https://www.statista.com/chart/11355/how-americans-commute-to-work/)).
With a guess of a 20 minute commute time,
gives `37461/(.854*(150*10^6)*(40/60)*(5/7)*365)` or about $1.7 \cdot 10^{-6}$ chance per hour of a fatality (car).
