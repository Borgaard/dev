Examples

### Matrix

| | |
|---|---|
| 1.Intro | Agents attack on Trinity and her narrow escape |
| 1.Normal | Neo in front of his computer and later going to his day job |
| 1.Event | Agents come to interrogate Neo at his work and ensuing chase and capture |
| 1.Call | Neo is told he's "the one" |
| 1.Refusal | But Neo doesn't believe it... |
| 2.Confidence | Neo learns Kung Fu |
| 2.Subplot | Oracle tells Neo he needs to make a choice, Trinity as a love interest (via Oracle), Cypher is a spy |
| 2.Loss | Agents attack the group |
| 2.Disaster | Morphius is taken, most of the crew is murdered |
| 2.Despair | Morphius is captured and being interregated |
| 3.Reversal | Neo and Trinity decide to attack |
| 3.Climax | Neo defeats agents |
| 3.New | Neo leaves a message for the computers |

Not all fits neatly into this structure and there's a lot of variation, including how the subplots weave into
the main hero's journely and adventure (which maybe is why Matrix is so well written).
There might be some disagreement over what the sub plot is (or even if there's just one) and how
it feeds into the reversal.
Also, a lot of the events are not done in order.

It seems like the basic story structure is still valid, though.

### Blade Runner

| | |
|---|---|
| 1.Intro | Leon is interviewed and kills Blade Runner |
| 1.Normal | Deckard ordering noodles |
| 1.Event | Gaaf calls on Deckard to come to the police station (?) |
| 1.Call | Deckard is asked to hunt replicants |
| 1.Refusal | Deckard initially refuses but accepts after being threatened by police cheif and hearing about the attack on the other Blade Runner |
| 2.Confidence | Deckard interviews Rachael and discovers she's a replicant |
| 2.Subplot | Deckards romance with Rachael |
| 2.Loss | Deckard confronts and kills Zora |
| 2.Disaster | Deckards shakes (?) |
| 2.Despair | (?) |
| 3.Reversal | Deckard tracks Priss down to Sebastian's apartment |
| 3.Climax | Deckard and Roy fight |
| 3.New | Deckard runs off with Rachael |

I'm not sure this format exactly works with this theme as there's no real inciting event, disaster or despair scenario for Deckard
but there are many aspects that fit.
It should also be noted that Roy Batty could be considered the main character.
It could be considered that the first act of Roy's journey is only eluded to with the rest of the movie being Roy's journey.

| | Roy Batty's journey |
|---|---|
| 1.Intro | Leon is interviewed and kills Blade Runner |
| 1.Normal | (?) |
| 1.Event | (?) |
| 1.Call | (?) |
| 1.Refusal | (?) |
| 2.Confidence | Escape or confrontation with Hannibal Chew |
| 2.Subplot | Priss and Roy make friends with Sebastian |
| 2.Loss | Deckard confronts Zora |
| 2.Disaster |  Zora and Leon are murdered |
| 2.Despair | Roy and Priss despair ("Then we're stupid and we'll die...") |
| 3.Reversal | Roy uses Sebastian to get a meeting with Tyrell |
| 3.Climax | Deckard and Roy fight |
| 3.New | Roy dies |

It seems that `Loss` and `Disaster` go hand in hand so maybe they shouldn't really be differentiated.

### My Fair Lady (movie)

| | |
|---|---|
| 1.Intro | High society leaving opera |
| 1.Normal | Eliza Doolitle selling flowers |
| 1.Event | Henry and Eliza meet outside of the Opera house |
| 1.Call | Eliza comes to Henry's house and asks for lessons |
| 1.Refusal | Henry initially refuses but accepts after Hugh offers a wager to Henry to teach Eliza |
| 2.Confidence | Eliza passes at the ball |
| 2.Subplot | Freddie is smitten with Eliza and is set up as a love interest |
| 2.Loss | Eliza is worried about what she'll do now that the experiment and bet is over |
| 2.Disaster | Eliza leaves |
| 2.Despair | Eliza and Henry are distrought over their separation |
| 3.Reversal | Eliza is accepted by others (Pickering, Freddie and Henry's mother) |
| 3.Climax | Eliza and Henry negotiate. Eliza leaves for Freddie |
| 3.New | Henry misses Eliza and then she returns |

I'm not sure how well this movie follows the format.
One interpretation is that the horse race is the start of act 2 instead of the ball but
it could be thought of as the horse race being a small sub act 1 stuffed at the end of act 1.
It's also not clear what the reversal is or if it can be cleanly separated.

Maybe it's that there are really two main characters, Henry and Eliza, where Henry's
initial journey is to raise Eliza up and morphs into a fight to keep Eliza whereas
Eliza's journey is to improve her life.
