Temporary Frame Build
---


We still don't have the motors or the L brackets for the sled.
We got the lumber and built the temporary frame in anticipation.
We tried to follow as closely as possible the
["How To Assemble The Temporary Frame"](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/wiki/How-To-Assemble-The-Temporary-Frame)
from the MaslowCNC wiki.

We first cut the 2x4s into thier appropriate lengths.
Three 10 foot 2x4 beams gave:

* 2x 57" pieces
* 2x 53" pieces
* 2x 39 3/8" pieces
* 2x 18" pieces
* 2x 6" pieces

For the 57" pieces, we used one 10' beam and measured from each end,
leaving about a 6" piece in the middle.
For the rest, we measured a 53" piece from one end of the beam
then a 39 3/8" piece from the other side, cut then measured the
18" and 6" piece on the remaining piece and repeated this
process again to get the rest of the pieces we needed.

In addition to the two 11x8 feet plywood boards, we purchased a
thin 1/4" interface board to protect the backing spoiler board.

We laid out one of the plywood sheets onto two saw horses and cut out
two 5 1/2" squares from the corner for the motor mounts.

We used the same side to cut out a 8 1/2" x 11" temporary sled.
We used the [printout provided by the Maslow assembly guide](https://github.com/MaslowCNC/Mechanics/blob/master/tempSled.pdf)
taped that to the cutout piece and drilled five holes, one for the
center and four for the L bracket positions.
The center hole was done with a hole saw that we had.
The other four holes were counter sunk with a 1/4" drill and then
drilled out with a 3/8" bit.

We made sure to counter sink on the 'smooth' side, making the rough side
facing 'out'.

We swapped out the cut plywood board for the whole plywood board and started
attaching the cut plywood pieces for the motor mounting arms and temporary
base.

We took the two 18" pieces and attached them to the base with 12" sticking
out the ends, leaving 6" underneath, temporary keeping them in place
with a vise.
We put two wood screws in at a 1" distance from the edges of each corner
that the 6" piece overlapped with the plywood board.

For the two 39 3/8" motor mounting pieces, we measured 20" away from the corner
of the backing plywood board, keeping them in place with a vise.
As in the picture for the Maslow instructions, the 39 3/8" motor mounting pieces
come out of the 'side' of the backing plywood board.
We traced a rough outline of the 39 3/8" motor mounting pieces on the backing
plywood board.
We made pencil croses inside of the trace, leaving 1" clearences on the sides.
We used a total of 5 wood screws to fasten the arm.

Once the 39 3/8" motor mounting pieces were attached, we attached the 5 1/2" motor
mounting pieces to them.
We traced a 1/2" and 1" line from the bottom edge of 5 1/2" motor mounting squre
and screwed in 6 staggered wood screws to attach them.
We made sure the hole meant for the chain was positioned as far away from the
plywood backing and the 39 3/8" motor mounting piece.

That's it for today!
Now we wait for the motors, L brackets and the router.
