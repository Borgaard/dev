Complexity and Criticality
===

Complexity and criticality, in the physics sense of the word,
refer to complex behavior from the repeated application of simple
rules and the study of systems at or near phase transitions.

These notes follow Christensen and Moloney's book "Complexity and Criticality".
The three major points will be:

* The Bethe lattice as a basis for talking about complexity and criticality
* The Ising model
* The rice pile model

Bethe Lattice
---

The Bethe lattice is an infinite rooted tree of degree $z$.
Since the Bethe lattice is a tree, each leaf of the root node is independent,
often times allowing for simple analysis.
Any given node can be thought of as the root of the tree, giving the tree
a symmetry that also helps in analysis.

Consider coloring each node of the tree black or white with probability $p$.
The following concepts are then considered:

* $p_c$ - critical probability when an infinite cluster appears
* $chi(p)$ - average cluster size
* $n(s,p)$ - density of cluster size $s$
* $s_{\eps}$ - characteristic cluster size (explained below)


* $P_{\inf}(p)$ - probability root node is part of infinite cluster
