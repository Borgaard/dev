Market capitalization is the outstanding shares times the share price.

As of 2014, the estimated total market capitalization of the [world's domestic companies](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)
is in the $64 trillion range.  (64 * 10^12).

As of today (Dec. 3, 2017) `16,718,425 BTC * $11,404.50 = 190665277912.50` or around $190B.
For comparison, Amazon has a market capitalization now of $560B.

If we assume Bitcoin grows to 10% of the total global market capitalization, that would put it at about $5T.
Assuming all 21M bitcoins get mined, that puts the total worth of each Bitcoin at
`$5T / 21M` or approximately `$238k/BTC`.

From the same [world bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD?year_high_desc=true) chart as above,
the USA is at around $27T with China at second with $7T, Japan at third with $4.9T.
This means the USA is 3x more than the next highest and around 8x the third highest.
