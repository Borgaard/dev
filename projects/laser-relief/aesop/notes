For some reason Inkscape refuses to save svgs as the proper size, resulting
in a rescaled svg after the path trace.
The magic number looks to be 25.4/90 (90dpi being the default for Inkscape somewhere)
that can be used to rescale after it's been converted to svg.
I could also use the 'pngtopnm | potrace' trick, which might be easier.
