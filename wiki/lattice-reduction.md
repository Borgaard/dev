### Lattice Reduction

There seem to be two main methods of using lattice reduction
techniques for other norms.  The first looks to be to use
a linear programming step in place of the 'weak reduction' step
(the Gram-Schmidt reduction step).  The second is embedding
the base in a higher dimension with extra structure and giving
bounds on how far it is from the different norm.
