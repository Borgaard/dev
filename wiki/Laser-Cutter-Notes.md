Laser Cutter Notes

| Material | Elastic Modulus (GPa) | Yield Strength (GPa) |
|----------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Acrylic | 3.2 | 0.072 |
| Delrin | 1.5 | 0.099 |
| MDF | 4 | 0.02 |
| Rubber | 0.01-0.1 | 0.001-0.007 |
| Wood (along grain) | | |
| Douglas Fir | 13 | 0.03-0.05 |
| Oak | 11 | 0.05-0.1 |
| Pine | 9 | 0.05-0.1 |

> ... The elastic modulus is a measure of stress (force
> over a given area) over strain (extension over original length) and
> therefore has pressure units (GPa in the table). A smaller value indicates
> that the material is more flexible/compliant
> ...

> The yield strength of a material is the stress at which a material begins
> to deform plastically (i.e. it will not return to its original configuration).
> ...
> If a material deforms plastically, it is no longer considered compliant

> When selecting a material, look for a proportionally low elastic
modulus and high yield strength.
