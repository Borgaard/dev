MaslowCNC SVGs
===

Inkscape has problems with opening the SVGs provided by the MaslowCNC folks.
This maybe has to do with scaling, units or other issues with Inkscape (maybe [bug #16700913](https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1670913)?).

I've found using `karbon` can read the SVG files properly and can then export them to an SVG that Inkscape can then read.
