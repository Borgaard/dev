Creative Electronics: A Short Introduction to Physical Computing
===

This is a course designed to expose students to
creative electronics with a focus on artistic, wearable and
other physical computing projects.

The course is necessarily a biased highlight of
projects I have experience in.
The hope is that with a few directed projects focusing
on different aspects of electronics and programming as they
apply to "physical" projects, the student will be able to
use what they've learned as a starting point for other projects.

The course will be a series of sessions, each with a specific project
goal in mind.
After each session, there should be a completed physical project highlighting
one aspect of electronics or programming.

### Personal Introduction

To start, let me tell you a little about myself!
I'm Abe, nice to meet you!

I'm a computer scientist, software developer, researcher
and electronics hobbyist!
I've been programming for 20+ years and have, within the
past five years or so, started doing and learning
more about electronics.

Here's a small selection of some of my projects:

* Animatronic Cat Ears
* Electroluminescent Jacket
* Laser Jacket

In the past ten years or so, electronics has become so much
more accessible than when I was younger, both in terms of cost,
community and learning resources.

Even so, it can be intimidating to someone who has limited knowledge
of programming and electronics to see how accessible it is to create
interesting projects.
I know I was intimidated by electronics since I was young!
I couldn't even buy a resistor because I didn't know the answer
to the question of "what wattage would like that in".

Hopefully, by the end of this course, you'll see how straight forward
it is to get started, even with limited knowledge.
We can get pretty far with understanding how to plug things in and do
an internet search for help!

### Course Introduction

This course is laid out in a series classes, with each class focusing on
an aspect of programming or electronics.
Each class is meant to be as self contained as possible with the result
of each class a tangible, completed small project.

The course cost, $100, is meant to cover all the materials needed as well as give
a little money to me (hope you don't mind).
The course is meant to be 'needs blind' in that anyone not able or willing
to spend $100 should not be prevented from participating.
If the course cost is what's preventing you from coming, please talk to me
and we can figure something out, either by me covering materials costs or
having someone help out with sourcing materials.

Programming and electronics is a big field, even when restricted to 
physical computing.
The focus is a combination of what I think is interesting, enlightening
and what I have experience in.
Just know that there's way more out there than I could know or teach.
I've tried to pick interesting aspects of computing and electronics
as well as projects that people will find fun and fulfilling.

The projects will all consist of a combination of programming, electronics,
laser cutting and crafting.
This will be a 'projects first' course, where we'll focus on making completed
project.
I will also try to give enough theory behind each project so that everyone
understand what goes on 'under the hood' but the focus will be on making
functional projects.
Further references will be provided for anyone wanting to research each
aspect more.

Each class will give a brief introduction to the materials being used,
both in how to use them and the 'theory' behind how they work.
The materials description will be followed by a programming, assembly
and documentation
period where each student will create and document the project.
Students are encouraged to work in groups.
After the assembly period, each student will present what they've assembled
to the class and deliver a short description of their project, what decisions they
made and why they made them.

This is a "living" course in that the materials, outline and curriculum can
change!
The course materials are all free/libre/open licensed, so comments,
suggestions and updates are all encouraged!
Using this course for you or others is also highly encouraged!

### Projects Overview

Each project will usually consist of three elements:

* Making things light up
* Making things move
* Sensing things

### Course Schedule

Tech:

* led + arduino
* led strip
* led matrix
