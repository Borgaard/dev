From the Wikipedia entry on [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software):

This is an attempt to create a list of projectst to reconcile
claims of openness with whether they actually are open.

Often times companies claim that their projects are "open source",
either computer source code, design files or other digital artifacts,
but either fail to provide the source or fail to provide proper
licensing.

When talking about other digital assets, either art files, design files, documentation,
etc., what constitutes the analog of "open source" can get confusing, but I will generally
take it to mean that they provide the fundamental copyrightable material to help with or
recreate the project under a license that respects the freedoms of being able to run or create,
to study, to change and to distribute, including distribution for commercial purposes.
