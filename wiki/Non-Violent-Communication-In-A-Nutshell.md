> When [observation], I feel [emotion] because I need [need].
> Would you be able to [request]

Observation
---

> Strive for observations rather than evaluations

* Observe events rather than evaluate or interpret what happened

An evaluation is an interpretation of events.
Communicating observations is the difference between
showing evidence and communicating conclusions.

### Examples

* "You ignored me" vs. "You didn't respond to the three emails I sent"
* "You don't respect me" vs. "You didn't show up to our meeting on time"
* "Your work is sloppy" vs. "Your report was inaccurate"

Emotion
---

> Communicate emotions rather than thoughts

* Focus on what emotion you're feeling rather than an interpretation of what someone else is feeling
* If you can substitute 'I think...' then it's a thought, not an emotion.


### Examples

* "I feel you aren't taking this seriously" vs. "I feel frustrated"
* "I feel blamed" vs. "I feel frustrated" ("I think you're blaming me" vs. "I'm frustrated")
* "I feel rejected" vs "I feel hurt" ("I think you're rejecting me" vs. "I'm hurt")

Need
---

> Declarative needs instead of communicating strategies

Perhaps a form of "declarative vs. imperative".

* Communicate universal needs without including the other party

### Examples

* "I need you to copy me on all communication" vs. "I need transparency" 

Request
---

> Request rather than demand

* Make sure it's specific and actionable
* Communicate what you want, not what you don't want

### Examples

* "Could you respect me?" vs. "Could you arrive on time to dinner?"

---

* Keep the statements concise ("40-word rule")
* Understand how the other party will interpret what's presented
* Try to work towards common goals where both parties gain
