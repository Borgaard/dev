Market Fit Testing
---

* Youtube devlog video - look for number of views and whether the number is growing
* Steam Greenlight - make sure to get a greenlight and look for enough "yes"es to justify development
* Post on Twitter - set a retweet threshold to consider success (25 for example)
  - use animated GIFs
  - use feedback to course correct
* Steam Greenlight ideas page - set a comment threshold (50 for example) (doesn't exist anymore?)
* Run crowdfunding - requires a good fan base which should have been developed from devlog and Twitter exposure

Notes
---

* Communicate a clear vision of what the game will be like without requiring the player to play it
  - For example, a short 2-10s clip of gameplay that gives an idea of what the core gameplay is
  - Rocket League - soccer with rocket powered cars
  - Paper's Please - a border agent in a dystopian society

---

With "Kingdoms and Castles":

* Concept is "build and manage a medieval city"
* Screenshots are taken at an angle and scale that are familiar from other city building games

---

Relying on existing metaphors helps with learning and gameplay along with short attention span communication.
Every novel mechanic needs to be rethought.
Novel mechanics can be done but the cost of alienation has to be weighed against the potential benefits.

A good "rule of thumb" is that if the novel mechanic is core to the game design.
If it is, keep it, if it isn't, consider cutting it.

---

For indie developers, minimal, low poly or other 'simplistic' assets should be preferred.

---

Focus on the 'hooks' for marketability.

Also, marketing and gamedev are essentially synonymous.

---

Allow for people to 'act on their interest', either to look at devlogs, Youtube videos of gameplay, etc.

---

Discord allows for community interaction, including real time bug reports.

'#ideas' channel for game ideas but devs did not give an opinion on the ideas.
