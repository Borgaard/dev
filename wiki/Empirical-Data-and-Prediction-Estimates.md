World Economy
---

Market capitalization is the outstanding shares times the share price.

As of 2014, the estimated total market capitalization of the
[world's domestic companies](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)
is in the $64 trillion range.  (64 * 10^12).

From the same [world bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD?year_high_desc=true) chart as above,
the USA is at around $30T with China at second with $6.3T, Japan at third with $5.3T.
This means the USA is 3x more than the next highest and around 8x the third highest.

| Country | Market Cap. (2017) |
|---------|--------------------|
|   USA   |  $30T |
| China | $6.3T |
| Japan | $5.3T |


Bitcoin Estimates
---

As of Dec. 3, 2017 `16,718,425 BTC * $11,404.50 = 190665277912.50` or around $190B.
For comparison, Amazon has a market capitalization now of $560B.

If we assume Bitcoin grows to 10% of the total global market capitalization, that would put it at about $5T.
Assuming all 21M bitcoins get mined, that puts the total worth of each Bitcoin at
`$5T / 21M` or approximately `$238k/BTC`.

Population

| Country | Population (2019) |
|---------|-------------------|
| World | 7.63B |
| China | 1.43B |
| India | 1.35B |
| USA   | 327M |
