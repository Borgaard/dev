Each scene should have (at least one of) the character(s) change from `mad, sad, glad, scared`
to another.

Protagonist has to choose journey rather than having something to them.

Define `hero goal sequence` as a 2-7 minute section where the protagonist pursues a single, physical
short term goal as a single step to achieve overall story goal. After which the protagonist discovers
something that puts an end to the current pursuit and offers a new single, physical short term goal.

* Act I: 6 "hero goal sequences" 
  - 6th "hero goal sequence" is "stunning surprise" and starts Act II
* Act II: 12 "hero goal sequences"
  - First part of Act II contains 6 "hero goal sequences"
  - 6th "hero goal sequence" contains the midpoint sequence
  - Second part of Act II contains 6 "hero goal sequences"
  - 12th "hero goal sequences" contains "stunning surprise 2"
* Act III: 2-5 "hero goal sequences"
  - 3 is average
  - 5 is often too long

"Standard" is 21 "hero goal sequences".

Misc
---

* Have an active protagonist that participates and makes choices about their fate instead of having things just
  happen to them.
* Make a protagonist that has clear visible goals
* (Maybe only for comedies) have protagonist have learning moments where initial goal changes
* Each minute should have ticking clocks, realising stakes, good news / bad news
* Need peaks and valleys of intensity
* Protagonist should have flaws, should have sympathy for antagonist
