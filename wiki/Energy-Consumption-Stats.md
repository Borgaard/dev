Energy Consumption Stats
===

From the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3):

* Average yearly usage of 10.812 MWh (Megawatthours)
* ~30kWh daily usage

Highs of 15.435MWh (~42.28kWh/day) to lows of 6.166MWh (~17kWh/day).

As of now, for a consumer solar it's about $1 per Watt of solar.
Assuming a 12 hour window of sun at full power, and 36kWh usage, thats 3kW or
about $3k for the solar panels (at about .6x1x.035 m^3).

As of now, for consumer deep cycle lead acid batteries, it's about $.15 / (Watt hour).
At 36kWh, thats about $5400.

A LiFePO4 32650 5.5Ah 3.2V rechargeable battery goes for ~$120.00 / 80 units.
At 36kWh, that works out to about `(120 / (80*5.5*3.2)) * 36000 = $3070`

This does not include all the control hardware and electronics that are needed
for proper usage.

As a rough estimate, New York average price for $.1854 / kWh at 601 kWh / month
for about $111.32 / month or $1335.84 / year.
